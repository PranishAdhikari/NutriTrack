# NutriTrack

This project was designed with the intention of creating an application that assisted those who had problems with dieting, exercising, and efficient weight loss. 

This app was created by Pranish, Jaxon, and Chris as the final project for IT3048C

We used .NET MAUI and Visual Studio to create this application and added UI properties and developed a PowerPoint presentation to go along with the demonstration of this final project.

We hope you enjoy!
